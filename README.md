# COMP 524: Programming Language Concepts
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for Programming Language Concepts (COMP 524). Note that these aren't all complete, and you can find Professor Terrell's solutions [on his website](https://comp524sp21.cs.unc.edu/assignments_). In addition, the essays I have written for this class are not all refined either, as not much time was given to do them, and since they were being peer reviewed by apathetic students, I tried to make them entertaining.
