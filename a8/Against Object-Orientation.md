# Against Object-Orientation
The great computer scientists of the past created entire operating systems without it. The great minds behind the moon landing [did not need it either](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11). Yet, today's so-called 'programmers' cannot even make a basic web app without it. Object-orientation is lauded as the building blocks of computer science, but the truth is, it is merely the opium of the people.

## Primer: the Principles of Object-Orientation
Object-orientation is generally defined around 4 principles:
1. **Encapsulation**. Encapsulation is concerned with the restricting of data, usually through the creation of getter-setter methods to manipulate fields.
2. **Abstraction**. Abstraction is concerned with the hiding of complexity, and in object-oriented programming, the division of units of meaning into classes.
3. **Inheritance**. Inheritance is concerned with expressing abstractions in terms of the relationships with each other, especially in terms of "parent-child" or "is-a" relations.
4. **Polymorphism**. Polymorphism is concerned with the morphing of various forms.

While these principles are not inherently bad, object-orientation does not always achieve them well or its achievement ends up being bad.
